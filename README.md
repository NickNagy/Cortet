STM32 (Nucleo F767ZI) interactive audio processing device with an LCD display.

All **arm_x.c** and files **arm_math.h** are sourced from the CMSIS DSP library.

**ILI9341.c/.h** sourced from here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1f4WZ3Bz8Tb-dCiqacXoX_CF3trXw5EcH/view, linked from this tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUErX4dx2Tw. Some changes/additions to functions and address spaces.

I am writing up a tutorial on how to configure / debug FMC for LCD communication on STM32 devices. Here is the link: https://github.com/NickNagy/Cortet/wiki/FMC-for-8080-LCD-interface-(STM32-Nucleo-F767ZI---ILI9341-240x320-TFT).
